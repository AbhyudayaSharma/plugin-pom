### 2.30

Release date: 2017, May 25

* Integrated `maven-hpi-plugin` 2.0:
  * The `war-for-test` artifact is no longer needed for functional tests, saving download bandwidth.
  * Bundled Jetty was updated, so JDK 8 is required at build time.
* Setup Wizard disabled by default when using `hpi:run`. To enable it use `-Dhudson.Main.development=false`.

### 2.29

Release date: 2017, May 19

### 2.28

Release date: 2017, May 04

* Updated `access-modifier-checker` to fix a critical bug (lack of enforcement of any method calls).

### 2.27

Release date: 2017, May 02

* Updated `maven-hpi-plugin`, `jenkins-test-harness`, and more.
* Support for building JavaScript libraries with yarn.
* Ability to specify `jenkins-core.version` and `jenkins-war.version` separately so as to depend on timestamped snapshots of Jenkins core.

### 2.26

* Update `frontend-maven-plugin` from `1.3` to `1.4` ([PR#53](https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-pom/pull/53))

### 2.25

Release date: 2017, Mar 22

* [JENKINS-42800](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-42800) - 
Bump JaCoCo version from `0.7.2.201409121644` to `0.7.9` to be compatible with [Jenkins JaCoCo plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/jacoco) data format.

Compatibility notes:
* The change introduces the new reporting format in JaCoCo. 
It may cause regressions in build flows which have the `enable-jacoco` profile enabled.

### 2.24

Release date: 2017, Mar 08

* Updated `frontend-maven-plugin` and `download-maven-plugin` for the benefit of plugins using npm.
